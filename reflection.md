- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

Instead of overriding the goToFloor function for library, I overloaded its goUp and goDown function. This was done to reflect the presence of an elevator in the building, and to give the option of moving throughout the building with either foot or the elevator. I don't understand why the goToFloor function had to be overloaded, as it already enables the person to move between floors only given the number of the destination floor (similar to an elevator).
Additionally, I overloaded the house constructor to enable it to create a house object only given the address.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
